# Portfolio
## This is a work in progress, as I continue my education, specializing in UX / UI Design.
First portfolio created when Front End Web Development Essentials was finished. This includes projects in Data Analytics and Front End with HTML, CSS, and JS. This will be a work in progress, constantly updated as I gather new skills.
I'm refining this project so that I can use it as my UX/UI Design portfolio once I complete my certification and also show my programming skills.
