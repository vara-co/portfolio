                  <p>Collaborative leaflet project to showcase different skills learned during the Data Analytics Bootcamp by Denver University. My part on this project was the Interactive map by using JavaScript and Leaflet. The cool thing about this interactive map, aside of the toggling options, is the fact that the markers for the Total Eclipse section reference the duration of the event, by the size of the marker, thus reflecting a pattern. I also created the Pie Chart.</p>
